what it wants to do:

./run-test
fetch + compile latest git
fetch latest test-game
runs spring + testgame


run-test.exe
fetch + compile latest git
fetch latest test-game
run spring + testgame


what is needed:

environement to compile spring (bad!)
downloader for game with tests included


=general=
 * extra namespace
 * add an --force switch to force redownloading/updating (override cache)
 * make some things configureable
 * fix build system (code-plugable)
 * add version-check (for current stable / getting download-link / ...)

=library=
 * make lib + header
 * add init function to set data-dir
 * disable logging
 * make logging configurable, cron/script-compatible, quiet mode, remove printf?
 * keep somewhere a log what happened

=http=
 * if filename != gamename, file can't be found through current sf interface

=plasma=
 * search for posibility to disable writing RECV.log/SEND.log in debug builds

=rapid=
 * use /packages/selected.list for pinned tags / downloaded files
 * dont download directly to pool or packages dir but to a temp dir
 * use c++ streams http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3023988/can-one-read-a-remote-file-as-an-istream-with-libcurl ?
 * (clean?) duplicate search results (with same md5)
 * delete old games?
 * check for errors

=widget=
 * remove it or finish it? it does't fit to the other downloaders (widgets are not needed to play the game...)
 * backup for old widgets (before getting overwritten)
